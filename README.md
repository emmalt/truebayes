This repository contains code to train and use the **PERCIVAL** neural networks described in "Learning Bayes' theorem with a neural network for gravitational-wave inference" by A. J. K. Chua and M. Vallisneri ([arXiv:1909.05966](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05966)).

See also "ROMAN: Reduced-Order Modeling with Artificial Neurons" by A. J. K. Chua, C. R. Galley, and M. Vallisneri 
([Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 211101 (2019)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.211101) or [arXiv:1811.05491](http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1811.05491)).

The code is demonstrated in the `notebooks/Percival.ipynb` Jupyter notebook, which can be opened in Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) by clicking on the badge above.
